# The **Nine and Square** Challenge

## Background
**Nine and Square** is fictional wine merchant company, established in 1999 by Merlot Brusque, offering prime quality French fantasy wines in exchange for BeanCoin. They sell fantasy wines for customers in UK, Italy, Thailand, Australia and Canada.

So far, the company has not based its decisions on the data it has generated in recent years from sales, but as part of an ongoing modernization process they want to become more data driven.

You are in charge of analyzing the data and make recommendations for the management.

## The datasets
- customers.csv
- products.csv
- suppliers.csv
- orders.csv

## Tasks

### Task 1
Most of the product records was inputted by the account management team, and because hey are people they made mistakes.
Examine the dataset, fill the missing data and fix the incorrectly entered data. Note, the products keep the basic properties (sweetness, colour, region) through the vintages.

### Task 2
As Nine and Square's web system acts up time to time, some customers had to recreate their account. Examine the customers dataset and remove the unnecesssary duplicates.

### Task 3
The company wants to introduce a loyalty program for the customers who spent their precious BeanCoins on wines in the last 5 years. Collect the customers in a table who have bought from us every year for the past 5 years and show how much they spent on wines year by year and in total. Sort them in descending order by total spend.

### Task 3
Visualize how the number of customers, the number of coins spent, and the number of orders have changed over the years. Make predictions about how these figures will turn out by the end of the year. 

### Task 4
Divide the customers into 5 groups based on their spend. Visualize how many customers moved accross these band in the last 3 years.

### Task 5
In order for the company to simplify its supply-chain, we need to assess which suppliers perform the worst. Help the company decide which supplier to say goodbye to.

### Bonus Task
Examine the datasets and formulate any question you are curious about and try to answer it.
